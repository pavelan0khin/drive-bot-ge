## Internationalization Information:

### Contributing to Translations:

If you've found any translation errors, you're welcome to help in rectifying them. The supported languages can be found in the `/locales/` directory. To make changes, edit the appropriate `.po` file. If you prefer, you can use an internationalization service (e.g., Transifex), or you can manually translate the texts within the files. Once done, you can submit a pull-request with your changes.

If you'd like, you can also send me your translation suggestions via a file on Telegram at [@anokhinpavel](https://t.me/anokhinpavel). I will review it and, if everything is alright, I'll incorporate it into the project.

**Note:** Please be aware that the original text was initially translated into other languages using Google Translate. Naturally, there might be several mistakes. Due to my lack of expertise in those languages, I couldn't verify the translation's accuracy.
